## Description
This project is course work for DH2321 - Information visualization. The task was to create a visualization of world values of different contries with data from [World Value Survey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp). The data include qualitative values of different aspects of life such as importance of religion, feeling of freedom, happiness, and so on.

The approach was representing the data at a glance in a map of the world, let the user select data of multiple countries to study any correlations of different values and at the same time compare different regions in the same aspect. I was happy to conclude, among other things, the world is (accordingly to this data) in fact getting happier! :smiley:

## Implementation

Data was available in .csv spreadsheets from [WVS](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp) which was exported to JSON by writing a python script. Basic HTML and CSS was used to set up the page which is hosted on GitHub pages. The radial charts, maps, etc. was made with D3JS.
